Use it to compare the return and volatility of two assets. Also, get the Global Minimum Variance weighted distribution for the portfolio. Run the app or use the endpoints!

# Return 

A return, also known as a financial return, in its simplest terms, is the money made or lost on an investment over some period of time. This Daisi calculates the daily return of two cryptocurrencies over a specified timeframe.
It also gets you the total return in the timeframe.

# Volatility

Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. The volatility is calculated daily as the standard deviation in the last 30 days of the assets' returns.

# Global Minimum Variance Portfolio

The global minimum variance portfolio (GMVP) allocates a given budget among financial assets such that the variance of the portfolio return is minimized.
